### Project Overview
---
This data analysis aims to generate insights into key areas within the business that could give rise to issues, such as the gender pay gap, among other potential issues and provide recommendations for management’s attention to future gender equality within the organisation. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions and determine the data's best performance. 

### Data Sources
---
The primary data source used here is Plamora Group emp-data.csv, which is open data that can be freely downloaded from an open-source online or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used

- Power Bi Transform Data Queries (for data Cleaning )
-  Power Bi Data Preview Column quality, column distribution ( For Data integrity and distinct value)
-  Dax Functions ( for New measures )
- Power BI (for Data Visualization)
### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling empty variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting
   
### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data, such as:

1. What is the gender distribution in the organisation? Distil to regions and 
departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
there is a gap, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management.
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000 
   ● Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
   ● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
   ● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions
5. Allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating.
   ● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
   ●  Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of 
bonus) 
   ● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
